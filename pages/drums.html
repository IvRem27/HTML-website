    <p>A drum kit – also called a drum set, trap set (an abbreviation of the word "contraption")[1] or simply drums – is
        a collection of drums, cymbals, and other percussion instruments, which are set up on stands to be played by a
        single player,[2] with drumsticks held in both hands and the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat
        cymbal and the beater for the bass drum. Sometimes, there may be two bass drum pedals to assist the player in
        playing faster rhythms. A drum kit consists of a mix of drums (categorized classically as membranophones,
        Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 2) and idiophones ⁠– ⁠most significantly cymbals, but can also
        include the woodblock and cowbell (classified as Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 1).[3] In the 2020s,
        some kits also include electronic instruments (Hornbostel-Sachs classification 53). Also, both hybrid (mixing
        acoustic instruments and electronic drums) and entirely electronic kits are used.</p>
