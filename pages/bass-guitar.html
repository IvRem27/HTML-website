    <h1>Bass Guitar</h1>
    <img src="../img/bass-guitar.jpg" alt="bass guitar">
    <p>The bass guitar, electric bass or simply bass, is the lowest-pitched member of the guitar family. It is a plucked
        string instrument similar in appearance and construction to an electric or an acoustic guitar, but with a longer
        neck and scale length, and typically four to six strings or courses. Since the mid-1950s, the bass guitar has
        largely replaced the double bass in popular music.

        The four-string bass is usually tuned the same as the double bass, which corresponds to pitches one octave lower
        than the four lowest-pitched strings of a guitar (typically E, A, D, and G). It is played primarily with the
        fingers or thumb, or with a pick. To be heard at normal performance volumes, electric basses require external
        amplification. </p>
