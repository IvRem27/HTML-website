    <h1>Guitar</h1>
    <img src="../img/guitar.jpg" alt="guitar">
    <p>The guitar is a musical instrument that is used in a wide variety of musical styles. It typically has the six
        strings, but four, seven, eight, ten, and twelve string guitars also exist.

        Guitars are recognized as one of the primary instruments in blues, country, flamenco, rock music, and many forms
        of pop. There is also a solo classical instrument. Guitars may be played acoustically, where the tone is
        produced by vibration of the strings and modulated by the hollow body, or they may rely on an amplifier that can
        electronically manipulate tone. Such electric guitars were introduced in the 20th century and continue to have a
        profound influence on popular culture. </p>
